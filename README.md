# View-Based 3D Shape Retrieval

This code is an implementation of the method presented in the following paper:

Z. Lian, A. Godil, X. Sun, J. Xiao, "CM-BOF: visual similarity-based 3D shape retrieval using Clock Matching and Bag-of-Features",  Machine vision and applications, 2013.

Please note that I am not an author of this paper, and therefore the implementation may differ from the authorsâ€™.

## Dependencies

* Matlab.
* OpenGL.
* PhychToolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/).
* VLFeat (http://www.vlfeat.org/).
* Toolbox Graph (http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph).

## Instructions

To compile the mex files, please run the script "setup.m".

The function which computes the retrieval results for an entire dataset is:
"computeDistancesForDataset.m"
